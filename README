RaAddOns = Restful Authentication Add Ons
=========================================
Now that Rails 2.3.2 has application templates, I thought I'd take a stab at converting the restful_authentication tutorial at http://railsforum.com/viewtopic.php?pid=74245#p74245 into a template.  It started getting very messy, what with all the file edits, so I'm now taking a stab at creating a plugin out of the forgot_password updates in the tutorial.  This will help shrink my template alot and make it more modular at the same time.

I'm basically trying to copy the way technoweenie has his restful_authentication plugin hooking into the app.  Since my template is also installing the aasm plugin, I will be trying to hook into the app in the same place, rather than extend restful_authentication...because I'm still learning how to do all this.  Eventually, I want to make this plugin an actual extension of restful_authentication, rather than something that plugs in along side of it.  

So far, this plugin contains the following user.rb instance methods:
  * forgot_password
  * reset_password
  * recently_forgot_password?
  * recently_reset_password?
  * self.find_for_forget(email)
  * make_password_reset_code

You will need to add this at the top of your user.rb class:
include AuthorizationAddOns::Forgot
